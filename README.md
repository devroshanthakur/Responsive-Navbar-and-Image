# Responsive Navbar and Image

This project demonstrates a responsive website design featuring a hamburger menu for mobile devices and smooth image resizing based on the screen size. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing clean and modern design principles with easy navigation across various screen sizes.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Fullscreen Hamburger Menu**: On smaller screens, a hamburger icon is displayed, and when clicked, it expands into a fullscreen navigation menu.
- **Smooth Image Resizing**: The main content image resizes fluidly based on the user's screen, maintaining clarity and consistency.
- **Modern Styling**: Styled with CSS variables for easy customization, the design features smooth transitions and clean visual aesthetics.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   To get started, first clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devroshanthakur/Responsive-Navbar-and-Image.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:  
   Navigate into the cloned project directory and open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to see the website in action.
   
3. **View on Different Devices**:  
   Try resizing your browser window to see how the design adapts to different screen sizes. On smaller screens, the navigation will transform into a fullscreen menu when you click the hamburger icon.

## Usage

- **Hamburger Menu**: On screens smaller than 768px, the hamburger menu is activated. Clicking the hamburger icon will display the navigation links in fullscreen mode.
- **Responsive Image**: The main image resizes smoothly based on the screen width. On smaller devices, the image takes up 80-100% of the screen width to provide an optimized visual experience.

## Customization

You can easily customize the colors and styles of the page by editing the `:root` CSS variables in the `style.css` file. For example:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #3498db;       /* Navbar background color */
    --secondary-color: #2c3e50;     /* Footer background color */
    --accent-color: #e74c3c;        /* Not used in this version */
    --background-color: #ecf0f1;    /* Main page background */
    --text-color: #34495e;          /* Main text color */
    --light-text-color: #ffffff;    /* Text color for navbar and footer */
}
```

Feel free to change the colors to match your branding or personal style.
